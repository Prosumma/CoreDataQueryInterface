Core Data Query Interface (CDQI) is a type-safe, fluent, intuitive library for working with Core Data in Swift. If you've worked with LINQ in the C# world, you can think of CDQI as "LINQ for Core Data".

## Syntax

The best way to understand the advantages of CDQI is to see an example.

```swift
for employee in managedObjectContext.from(Employee).filter({$0.salary > 70000 && $0.department == "Engineering"}).order(descending: {$0.lastName}, {$0.firstName}) {
  debugPrintln("\(employee.lastName), \(employee.firstName)")
}
```

Now compare this to vanilla Core Data:

```swift
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Employee")
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "salary > %ld && department == %@", 70000, "Engineering")
fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "lastName", ascending: false), NSSortDescriptor(key: "firstName", ascending: false)]
for employee in managedObjectContext.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest, error: nil)! as! [Employee] {
  debugPrintln("\(employee.lastName), \(employee.firstName)")
}
```

Which would you rather write?
