Core Data Query Interface (CDQI) is a type-safe, fluent, intuitive library for working with Core Data in Swift. CDQI tremendously reduces the amount of code needed to do Core Data, and dramatically improves readability by allowing method chaining and by eliminating magic strings. CDQI is a bit like jQuery or LINQ, but for Core Data.

### Features

- [x] [Fluent interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface), i.e., chainable methods
- [x] Large number of useful overloads
- [x] Type-safety in filter comparisons.
- [x] Filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregate expressions, limits, etc.
- [x] Optionally eliminates the use of magic strings so common in Core Data
- [x] Query reuse, i.e., no side-effects from chaining
- [x] Support for iOS 9+, macOS 10.11+, tvOS 9+, and watchOS 2+.
- [x] Swift 4

### Overview

In essence, CDQI is a tool that allows the creation (and execution) of fetch requests using a fluent syntax. In most cases, this can reduce many lines of code to a single (but still highly readable) line.

```swift
let swiftDevelopers = managedObjectContext.from(Developer.self).
                      filter(any(Developer.e.languages.name == "Swift"))
                      orderDesc(by: Developer.e.lastName)
                      .limit(5)
                      .all()
```

### Integration

#### Carthage

In your `Cartfile`, add the following line:

```ruby
github "prosumma/CoreDataQueryInterface" ~> 7.0
```

#### CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`. If it isn't already present, you will have to add `use_frameworks!` as well.

```ruby
pod 'CoreDataQueryInterface', '~> 7.0'
```

### Starting a Query

A CDQI query is a chain of methods that build an `NSFetchRequest`. Almost all of the `NSFetchRequest`'s functionality is supported, such as choosing the result type, limiting the number of records fetched, filtering, sorting, etc.

A query is started by creating an instance of `Query`, which takes two generic type parameters. The first one tells us which `NSManagedObject` subclass is the target of our query. The second tells us what the result of the query should be: Either the same `NSManagedObject` subclass or an `NSDictionary`.

```swift
let developerQuery = Query<Developer, Developer>()
let developerDictionaryQuery = Query<Developer, NSDictionary>()
```

Most `Query` instances are of the form `Query<M, M>` where `M` is an `NSManagedObject`. A perhaps better way to start a query isâ€¦

```swift
let developerQuery = Developer.cdqiQuery
```

Queries started with `Query<Developer, Developer>` or `Developer.cdqiQuery` have no implicit `NSManagedObjectContext`, so one must be passed when executing a query.

```swift
try Developer.cdqiQuery.order(by: Developer.e.lastName).all(managedObjectContext: moc)
try Developer.cdqiQuery,order(by: Developer.e.lastName).context(moc).all()
```

This pattern is so common that a convenience method exists on `NSManagedObjectContext`.

```swift
try moc.from(Developer.self).order(by: Developer.e.lastName).all()
```

### Filtering

Filtering in Core Data requires an `NSPredicate`. CDQI has overloads of many of the built-in operators. These overloads generate Core Data friendly `NSPredicate`s instead of `Bool`s. They are carefully designed so as not to conflict with the ordinary operators.

| Swift | `NSPredicate` |
| --- | --- |
| `Developer.e.lastName == "Li"` | `"lastName == 'Li'"` |
| `Person.e.age >= 18` | `"age >= 18"` |
| `21...55 ~= Person.e.age` | `"age BETWEEN 21 AND 55"` |
| `Person.e.firstName == "Friedrich"  && Person.e.lastName == "Hayek"` | `"firstName == 'Friedrich' AND lastName == 'Hayek'"` |
